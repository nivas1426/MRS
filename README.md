# MRS
In these modern days, many corporate employees experience stress and seek relaxation by watching movies they like. However, they often struggle to find the exact movies they want online. A Movie Recommendation System (MRS) is an ML-based model trained using TF-IDF, designed to recommend movies according to user preferences.

Dataset used : The Movies Dataset

Data Cleaning Overview: Data cleaning improves the quality and reliability of the dataset. Here's how we addressed common issues:

 1.Handling Missing Values: These can occur due to various reasons such as entry errors or incomplete records. We dropped rows and columns containing NULL values.    
 
 2.Data Type Conversion: Ensuring variables have appropriate data types is important for analysis and modeling. For example, in this model, we converted the data 
   type of the movie ID to a string. 
   
 3.Standardizing Data to the same format: Removing spaces between words,converting all text to lowercase,etc. comes under this category.This brought uniformity and        made comparison task easy.
